*"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first
lesson of economics."* - [Thomas Sowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell)

# What is Economics?

People hear the word "economics"and they immediately think about money. If I had a nickel everytime someone asks me about the stock market when I tell them I study economics, I would be a millionaire. I reckon most of the economists would feel the same way. Of course that is not their fault. Who doesn't want to get rich quick? Economics is not just about money. Economics is about making choices. an all encompassing definition of the field of economics is still used today given by [Lionel Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Robbins).

"*“Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.*"

# Why Should Study Economics?

Isn't it the best time to study economics? During this pandemic, unfortunately so many people have lost jobs, yet so many people have been benefitted leading to a rise in stock prices in some industries. The stock market seems to be booming and yet there are millions of people filing for jobless claims week after another. How is this possible? How come people in the lower end of the wage distribution are considered essential workers and still being paid lower wages? Isn't it interesting to find out what is happening? and if we do figure that out, what could be done (if it could be done) to help those who are most affected due to this pandemic. Strange things are happening all over the world right now and it is fascinating to figure things out. Studying economics is one way to ask difficult questions to find answers. But to answer those questions, we must first understand the basic principles of economics and equip ourselves with some basic tools to analyse the economics of everything that is happening around us.

We make all kinds of choices every day. How much should I spend on gas? What’s the best route to work? Where should we go for dinner? Which job or career should I go for? What are the pros and cons of finishing college versus taking a job or inventing the next, best Internet startup? Which roommate should take care of washing the dishes? Can I get that dog as a pet? Should I get married, have children, and if so, when? Which politician should I vote for when they all claim they can improve the economy or make my life better? What is “the economy,” anyway? What if my personal or religious principles conflict with what people tell me is in my best economic interest?


It is about weighing different choices or alternatives. Some of those important choices involve money, but most do not. Most of your daily, monthly, or life choices have nothing to do with money, yet they are still the subject of economics. For example, your decisions about whether it should be you or your roommate who should be the one to clean up or do the dishes, whether you should spend an hour a week volunteering for a worthy charity or send them a little money via your cell phone, or whether you should take a job so you can help support your siblings or parents or save for your future are all economic decisions. In many cases, money is merely a helpful tool or just a veil, standing in for a partial way to evaluate some of the goals you really care about and how you make choices about those goals.
