*"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first
lesson of economics."* - [Thomas Sowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell)

## What is Economics?

People hear the word "economics" and they immediately think about money. If I had a nickel every time someone asks me about the stock market when I tell them I study economics, I would be a millionaire. I reckon most of the economists would feel the same way. Of course, that is not their fault. Who doesn't want to get rich quick? Economics is not just about money. Economics is about making choices. an all-encompassing definition of the field of economics is still used today given by [Lionel Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Robbins).

*“Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between given ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.*"

## Why Should You Study Economics?

Isn't it the best time to study economics? During this pandemic, unfortunately so many people have lost jobs, yet so many people have been benefitted leading to a rise in stock prices in some industries. The stock market seems to be booming and yet there are millions of people filing for jobless claims week after another. How is this possible? How come people in the lower end of the wage distribution are considered essential workers and still being paid lower wages? Isn't it interesting to find out what is happening? and if we do figure that out, what could be done (if it could be done) to help those who are most affected due to this pandemic. Strange things are happening all over the world right now and it is fascinating to figure things out. Studying economics is one way to ask difficult questions to find answers. But to answer those questions, we must first understand the basic principles of economics and equip ourselves with some basic tools to analyse the economics of everything that is happening around us.

We make all kinds of choices every day. How much should I spend on gas? What’s the best route to work? Where should we go for dinner? Which job or career should I go for? What are the pros and cons of finishing college versus taking a job or inventing the next, best Internet startup? Which roommate should take care of washing the dishes? Can I get that dog as a pet? Should I get married, have children, and if so, when? Which politician should I vote for when they all claim they can improve the economy or make my life better? What is “the economy,” anyway? What if my personal or religious principles conflict with what people tell me is in my best economic interest?


It is about weighing different choices or alternatives. Some of those important choices involve money, but most do not. Most of your daily, monthly, or life choices have nothing to do with money, yet they are still the subject of economics. For example, your decisions about whether it should be you or your roommate who should be the one to clean up or do the dishes, whether you should spend an hour a week volunteering for a worthy charity or send them a little money via your cell phone, or whether you should take a job so you can help support your siblings or parents or save for your future are all economic decisions. In many cases, money is merely a helpful tool or just a veil, standing in for a partial way to evaluate some of the goals you really care about and how you make choices about those goals.


## Ten Principles of Economics

Now that we have established what economics is, we can move to define what an economy is. In simple words, an economy is a group of people interacting with one another as they go about their lives. The overall behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals participating in it. The way economists usually look at the economy is by defining what they call agents. For instance, a simple model of an economy will include households and firms as agents. They interact with each other and create an economy. More on this will be covered later.

Following are the ten principles of economics described in [Mankiw's introductory text](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Macroeconomics-N-Gregory-Mankiw/dp/1305971507) (Recommended Text in our course)

### People Face Trade-offs

There is a popular adage (somewhat cliched yet powerful)  **"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch"** communicating the idea that it is impossible to get something for nothing. In economics, this idea refers to a very important concept of **opportunity cost** (which we will look at in the following section). making choices requires trading off one goal against another.

A very simple example could be of a student like you named Elaine, who has to juggle her time between two subjects let us say economics (Of course) and sociology. The amount of time she spends studying for economics, she has to give up that time to study sociology. This basic principle is extremely important to keep in mind while analyzing policy issues.

*“There are no solutions, there are only trade-offs; and you try to get the best trade-off you can get, that’s all you can hope for"* - Thomas Sowell.

Here is the clip from famous sitcom "Seinfeld" which helps explain this concept. [TINSTAAFL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie1XGTYueHw)


If one individual or group gets something at no cost, somebody else ends up paying for it. If there appears to be no direct cost to any single individual, there is a social cost. Similarly, someone can benefit for "free" from an externality or from a public good, but someone has to pay the cost of producing these benefits. Have look at two classic examples of this : [Free rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem)  and [Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)

This gets more interesting when we are faced with a trade-off of efficiency and equality. Efficiency is defined as the property of society getting most it can from its scarce resources, whereas equality can be defined as the property of distributing economic prosperity uniformly among the members of the society. This is also a moral dilemma for us as a society. Imagine an economic pie, one example of an efficient outcome for a society would be that Mr. Bezos has the whole pie and we are left with nothing. But one would hardly ever think that is a great way to distribute the economic pie. (Nothing against Mr.Bezos, I do get my deliveries on time). On the other hand, if a governmental policy aimed at redistributing gains of the pie stops it from growing in the first place,, then we would never have a bigger pie. Our aim should be to have a pie as big as we could get while making sure that everyone is getting their fair share (That means ensuring the incentive structure in the economy). The efficiency-equality trade-off has been discussed for a long time in the field. Economists do disagree on that.

### Opportunity Cost

Back to Elaine. Now that we know Elaine must face a trade-off in every decision she makes, the question arises why would she choose one option over another? let us imagine her decision to attend a college. The benefits of going to college will include intellectual enrichment and a chance to get a better job after she finishes her degree. The cost of going to college is her spending on tuition, books and stationery among other things. But that is not the full cost. Since she is attending the college, she is giving up her leisure time. She could have stayed at home partying instead of attending the classes (not a good idea though). In fact, as she is a student at Baruch, we can assume she is smart and a higher ability student who is attending classes instead of earning wages in the market. So, these are the costs of attending the college in addition to tengible costs that we mentioned above. College athletes who can actually earn millions if they drop out of school and play professional sports are well aware that their opportunity cost of going to college is too high. So, the **Opportunity Cost** of an item is what you give up to get that item. In other words, it is the cost of the best possible alternative to the choice you make.
